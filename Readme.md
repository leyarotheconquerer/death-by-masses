Ludum Dare 44
=============

Entry for the Ludum Dare 44.

Theme: Your Life is Currency

Life is currency
The more life of your type, the more currency power you have
Fight all the other life to gain supremacy
The more supreme, the more buying power
Eventually you can buy your consciousness an entirely new and improved body
But only one of them
Then that body must fight its way to the top
All those old copies of yourself? Fight them into oblivion

Evolve to the top
Survival of the fittest

* Fighting game where you spawn more of yourself to fight with you
* When you reach a certain capacity, you can upgrade to new weapons and more powerful attacks/defenses
* But then all your copies will fight you as you again try to spawn more of yoursel

* Your health is aggregated over all your copies
* When you die, you respawn as one of your copies
* You lose if you have no remaining copies
* When you upgrade to the next level, all your copies are suddenly against you

Robot theme, because James says so.
