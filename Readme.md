Ludum Dare 44
=============

Entry for the Ludum Dare 44.

Theme: Your Life is Currency

Ideas

********

Game where you fight, but to upgrade your weapon or get new weapons/abilities, you must lose your life.
You gain life by:
* Killing enemies
* Picking up healing packs
* Passing goals/checkpoints

********

Game where you manage life forms of multiple varieties.

In order to buy resources/utilities to grow more of the life-forms you must kill other types of life

Maybe have three types of life:
* Plant
* Herbivore
* Carnivore

Plant needs fertilizer from Carnivores (and Herbivores?)
Herbivores need plant matter to eat
Carnivores need Herbivores to eat

If you feed any specific group enough it will upgrade
But if you kill it off, it will lose progress towards its upgrade

Spatial component might also be good
Though there should be a better way to add complexity to the game
Possibly by adding an interesting upgrade tree that adds options to each variety

*******

Currency as a time-travelling or travelling thing?
So you are only alive when you are present
But if you go back to the past, you don't yet exist
And if you go to the future, you are dead

Game mechanic:
* Time travel
* Dying and unexisting strategically to change the level so you can progress

Essentially a platform game where you must move back and forth in time to make progress in the present
Where you are alive

Maybe the idea of a civilization before it is alive and after it falls

Some key quote to key in on the theme:

>  A civilization lives only for a moment.
>  It's life is only current, never past, and never future.
>  Life is currency.

******

Life is currency

Life is an organism
Life is health
Life is the force of living

Your control of a character is currency
Want that really cool attack?
Give up the ability to jump
Want the ability to move really fast?
Lose the ability to control when you attack

******

Life is currency
The more life of your type, the more currency power you have
Fight all the other life to gain supremacy
The more supreme, the more buying power
Eventually you can buy your consciousness an entirely new and improved body
But only one of them
Then that body must fight its way to the top
All those old copies of yourself? Fight them into oblivion

Evolve to the top
Survival of the fittest

Fighting game where you spawn more of yourself to fight with you
When you reach a certain capacity, you can upgrade to new weapons and more powerful attacks/defenses
But then all your copies will fight you as you again try to spawn more of yoursel

Possibly aggregate your health over all your followers and you jump to another spawned self when you die.

Robot theme, because James says so.
