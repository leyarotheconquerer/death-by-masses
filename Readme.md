Death by Masses
===============

Fighting game where you spawn more of yourself to fight with you.

Entry for the Ludum Dare 44.

Theme: Your Life is Currency

This game did not reach its desired goal, so the theme was lost somewhere along the way.
However this is a playable minigame where you try to kill all the enemies.
